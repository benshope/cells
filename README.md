Cells are visual components. Each cell performs a single operation such as:

-   load data
-   filter data
-   display a bar chart

Cells can be combined so that, for example, one filter-cell can limit the data shown on several charts-cells.

## Install

-   **Npm:** `npm install react-cells`
-   **Yarn:** `yarn add react-cells`

## Options

See the [examples](https://benshope.github.io/modal-hook) and the [examples source code](https://github.com/benshope/modal-hook/blob/master/stories.js) for more snippets to copy.
