Powder is a combination of visual components for handling data. Each component performs a single operation such as:

- load data
- filter data
- display a bar chart

Components can be combined so that, for example, one filter-cell can limit the data shown on several charts-cells.

## Install

- **Npm:** `npm install powder`
- **Yarn:** `yarn add powder`

## Options
